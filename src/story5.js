                <p>The text is about Carole, a young girl with mixed racial heritage, on a plane journey. She sits with her doll and interacts with a couple, Henry and Betty. They ask her uncomfortable questions about her race. Carole, who just sees herself as her father’s daughter, feels confused and upset by their questions. She eventually stands up for herself and tells them to stop. A stewardess helps her by offering a new seat and a Shirley Temple, which makes her feel better. This review fits into my research by showing how other people's questions and labels can affect how someone sees themselves. Carole’s experience highlights the challenges faced by mixed-race individuals when others try to categorize them. It has made me realize that identity is personal and that it’s important to be respectful and sensitive when discussing it. This story has reinforced that identity can’t be defined by others and that everyone should have the freedom to define themselves.</p>

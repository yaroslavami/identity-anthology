            <h3>Let's analyze</h3>
            <p>In the opinion paragraph "This I Believe" by Julio, the author shares his view that in today's world, people sometimes have to be "bad guys," lie, or be hypocrites to survive. Julio believes that being bad or lying can protect you from being taken advantage of, but he also thinks it's important to be fair in certain situations. He shares two stories about car accidents to explain his point. In the first accident, Julio was honest and took responsibility, giving his real name and phone number. In the second accident, he faced big costs because the other driver ran away, making him realize that life isn't always fair and that sometimes cheaters win. However, Julio still believes that honesty is important when dealing with friends and family. The text shows how personal experiences and tough choices shape a person's understanding of honesty and fairness in a world that often rewards deceit. The text develops the theme of identity through the narrator's moral dilemma and the results of his actions in the first car accident. When Julio decides to be honest and give his real name and phone number to the elderly man, it shows his commitment to doing the right thing. He says, "I felt a little sorry for the man because he was so old. So I did the honest thing and gave him my actual name and number." This moment highlights Julio's struggle to balance compassion with the harsh realities of the world. Even though his honesty wasn't rewarded, it reinforces his self-image as a morally upright person.</p>
            <p>Julio's second car accident and his reflections on fairness further develop the theme of identity by contrasting his earlier actions with the unfairness he experienced. After being hit by another car and facing significant financial loss, Julio starts to question the value of his honesty. He observed, "The car that swerved into my lane just sped off. At the time I was not insured for that car and so the $3000 dollars worth of damage that resulted out of that accident ended up coming out of my parents’ pocket." This incident leads him to a cynical realization about the world, concluding that "Life really isn’t always fair." This change in perspective reveals a transformation in Julio's identity, as he understands that good actions don't always lead to positive outcomes and sometimes "cheaters prosper." "This I Believe" effectively explores the theme of identity by showing how personal experiences and moral challenges shape Julio's understanding of honesty and fairness. Through his encounters with car accidents and his reflections on them, Julio moves from a belief in straightforward honesty to a more complex view of the world. This change in perspective highlights the complexity of identity, which is shaped by the constant interplay between personal values and the realities of the world.</p>

                    <li>Carver, Raymond. The Father. 
                        mrskanenta.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/3/8/58387409/_the_father_text.pdf.  The 
                        text describes a family gathered around a baby in a basket, dressed in white 
                        with blue ribbons and blankets. They admire the baby’s features and debate 
                        who the baby looks like. Phyllis thinks the baby loves their dad, and the 
                        grandmother comments on the baby’s chubby hands. The mother calls the 
                        baby cute and healthy.The sisters try to figure out who the baby resembles, 
                        looking at its eyes, lips, and nose. They each suggest different family 
                        members but can’t agree. Phyllis finally says the baby looks like their dad, and 
                        Carol agrees. When asked who their dad looks like, they all look at the kitchen 
                        where he sits. Phyllis says he looks like no one and starts to cry. Grandma 
                        hushes her, and they all look at the father, who sits pale and expressionless. This story fits into my research by showing how families look for connections in new members.  The family’s search for familiar traits in the baby reflects their desire to understand and relate to him. This highlights how identity is shaped by family and the way others see us.

                    <li>Harris, Marley . 9 Tips to Change Your Identity. 16 July 2024, https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/moneymindsetmanifestation/episodes/9-Tips-To-Change-Your-Identity-e2m278p/a-abedmsc . podcast episode. 
                        The podcast episode starts with Marley discussing her new production methods. She explains that identity is what you believe you are and how you identify yourself. Marley stresses that to change your life, you need to change your identity. She offers nine tips for doing this:
                        <br/>1. Establish who you want to be: Make a list of what you want to be and compare it to what you are. Identify the differences and understand how to change them. 
                        <br/>2. Eliminate misalignments: Remove anything that doesn't align with the identity you want.
                        <br/>3. Take baby steps: Make small, gradual changes to feel more comfortable.
                        <br/>4. Live as your new self: Act, think, and speak as if you've already changed your identity.
                        <br/>5. Absorb your reality: Accept and feel your current reality.
                        <br/>6. Visualize your new identity: If you can't visualize it, write it down every morning.
                        <br/>7. Remove blocks: Identify and address fears related to your new identity.
                        <br/>8. Be inspired by others: Find inspiration in people you resonate with and believe you can do it too.
                        <br/>9. Adjust your thoughts: Control your thoughts to align with what you want to become.
                        <br/>This podcast fits into my research by showing practical steps for changing how we see ourselves and develop our identity. Marley’s tips highlight the active role we can take in shaping our identity, emphasizing that it’s not fixed but can be transformed with conscious effort. This has influenced my thinking by reinforcing the idea that identity is dynamic and that self-perception plays a crucial role in personal growth and change. It has provided me with concrete strategies for exploring how individuals can intentionally redefine their identity to align with their goals and aspirations.

                    <li>Julio. “This I Believe .” This I Believe, thisibelieve.org/essay/29905/ .
                        The text talks about how sometimes people have to lie or be hypocrites to survive in today’s world. The author shares two stories about car accidents to explain this idea. In the first accident, they were honest and took responsibility, giving their real name and phone number. But in a second accident, they faced big costs because the other driver ran away. This made the author realize that life isn’t always fair and that sometimes cheaters win. However, the author believes that honesty is important when dealing with friends and family. The author starts by believing in honesty but faces a tough choice when being honest causes problems. After two car accidents, one where they were honest and another where they suffered because someone else wasn’t, the author starts to think that sometimes you need to lie to survive. This change in thinking shows how our experiences can shape who we are and how we act. It has made me realize that identity is not fixed and can change based on what happens to us and the choices we make.

                        The text is about Carole, a young girl with mixed racial heritage, on a plane journey. She sits with her doll and interacts with a couple, Henry and Betty. They ask her uncomfortable questions about her race. Carole, who just sees herself as her father’s daughter, feels confused and upset by their questions. She eventually stands up for herself and tells them to stop. A stewardess helps her by offering a new seat and a Shirley Temple, which makes her feel better. This review fits into my research by showing how other people's questions and labels can affect how someone sees themselves. Carole’s experience highlights the challenges faced by mixed-race individuals when others try to categorize them. It has made me realize that identity is personal and that it’s important to be respectful and sensitive when discussing it. This story has reinforced that identity can’t be defined by others and that everyone should have the freedom to define themselves.
